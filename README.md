# Pitch Estimator With Adaptive Energy Threshold

This is a demo written in C++. It is written to implement adaptive short-term energy threshold with visual representation at run time. So basically, it includes modules for audio file reading & writing (in this case, WAV file), frame obtaining & processing (ACF calculation, energy calculation, filtering, etc.), and waveform plotting. Those modules are seperated so they could be used for other purpose.

To give an intuitive explanation, the picture below is given, showing how the demo performs when it operates.
